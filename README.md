# Contoso SQL - Sales Analysis

## Overview

## üí°Insight Questions
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Who contributes the most to the business?
2. **Cohort Analysis**: How do new customer groups generate our revenue?
3. **Retention Analysis**: Which customer groups haven't purchased recently?

## üéØAnalysis Approach
### 1. **Segmentation Analysis**
During this analysis I am going to break down how the different segments of contoso's consumer base impacts the revenue for the company. It has been divided into three groups conisting of: high-value customers, who are greater than the 75th percentile in purchasing, medium-value customers who are in between the 25th and 75th percentile in purchasing and finally low-value customers, who are less than the 25th percentile in purchasing. This allows us to see the numerical value associated with each group to make business decisions. This also shows insights into which customer segments are impacting our business positively and which one's need more targeting for increased revenue growth.

```
WITH customer_ltv AS(
	SELECT
		customerkey,
		concat,
		SUM(net_revenue) AS total_ltv
	FROM
		cohort_analysis
	GROUP BY
		customerkey,
		concat
), customer_segments AS (
SELECT 
	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_ltv) AS ltv_25th_percentile,
	PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_ltv) AS ltv_75th_percentile
FROM 
	customer_ltv
), segment_values AS (
SELECT
	c.*,
	CASE
		WHEN c.total_ltv < cs.ltv_25th_percentile THEN '1 - Low-Value'
		WHEN c.total_ltv < cs.ltv_75th_percentile THEN '2 - mid-Value'
		ELSE '3 - high-value'
	END AS customer_segment
FROM 
	customer_ltv c,
	customer_segments cs
)	
SELECT 
	customer_segment,
	SUM(total_ltv) AS total_ltv,
	COUNT(customerkey) AS customer_count,
	SUM(total_ltv) / COUNT(customerkey) AS avg_ltv
FROM
	segment_values
GROUP BY 
	customer_segment
ORDER BY
	customer_segment DESC
```

#### üîçThe raw data we get:

```
"customer_segment","total_ltv","customer_count","avg_ltv"
"3 - high-value",135429277.26549858,12372,10946.433661938132
"2 - mid-Value",66636451.787238546,24743,2693.143587569759
"1 - Low-Value",4341809.527328128,12372,350.9383711063796

#### üß†Can be intrepreted:
We have a significant amount of mid-value customers contributing to our net revenue but we would like to see how we can move those customers into the high-value area to further increase profits. 

#### ‚úÖUsing the data for decisions: 
This can be done by increased ad targeting by further analyzing what demographics are in this seciton or offering promotions that would incetive increased spending from our customers. 

### 2. **Cohort Analysis** 
This analysis will break down how active our new customers look compared to our total revenue for a specefied year. I want to see how many new customers we have each year and how much they contribute to the revenue we are bringing in. This will give us a clear indication of how well the business is performning and will implement any strategies to increase or maintain our customers. I think the most important aspect is to see their spending habits and what we can do with that information.

#### üß†Can be intrepreted:
In the first graph we can visually see that for the total customer/cohort year we have seen a general uptick in new customers from 2015-2020 (outlier in 2020 from a pandemic) and after that have seen an unfortunate decrease in new customers from 2022 and out. For the second graph it's easy to see that the total revenue/cohort year closely followed the customer/cohort year graph which makes sense when talking about customer purchasing and new customer attraction. The most concerning graph is the last graph which depicts a decrease in average revenue/customer/cohort year which tells us that the new customer is spending less and less on average each year which is concerning for long-term sustainability as a business. 

#### ‚úÖUsing the data for decisions: 
From the first two graphs, it's imparitive that we tackle the problems of why we aren't attracting new customers from 2022 and beyond. The data clearly shows that the attraction of new customers is falling and that is directly impacting our revenue streams. We need to form a solid plan with marketing to first attract these new customers and then retain for loyalty so they will eventually move up to the high-value customer status from the segmentation from before. After that, looking at the spending habits of the customer is essential because we see that from 2017 and onward we saw a dramatic decrease in average new customer spending and try and understand 1) why such a dramatic decrease from 2017 - 2018? and 2) what did we do well from 2015-2017 that each new customer was spending a good consistant amount?

### 3. **Retention Analysis**
This section is specefically dedicated to customer retention and how how it might relate to the other analyseses above when talking about key reveneue indicators. The goal is to see how many loyal customers we retain and at what % of our total customer base are considered loyal. This will give us good insights to how many we have in the first place and how we might be able to reatin more customers in the future.
